# Chatbot Projects

This repository contains two chatbot implementations:

1. **basic_bot.py** — A simple rule-based chatbot using NLTK.
2. **gptbot.py** — An advanced chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API, with a Gradio interface.

## 1. basic_bot.py

**Description:**  
A basic chatbot built using Python's NLTK library. It uses hardcoded patterns (regular expressions) and predefined responses to interact with the user.

**Key Features:**
- Responds to greetings, feelings, hobbies, and basic questions.
- Built using `nltk.chat.util.Chat` and `reflections`.
- Console-based interaction (run it from terminal/command prompt).
- Continues chatting until the user types "bye".

**Usage:**
1. Install NLTK if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```
2. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python basic_bot.py
   ```
3. Start chatting!

> Note: It downloads `punkt` (tokenizer models) at runtime.

## 2. gptbot.py

**Description:**  
An intelligent chatbot powered by OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. It provides much more dynamic, human-like responses and runs through a web interface created using Gradio.

**Key Features:**
- Uses OpenAI's API to generate responses based on conversation history.
- Remembers previous messages to maintain conversation context.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Gradio.
- Can be shared publicly through Gradio's `share=True` feature.

**Usage:**
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install openai gradio
   ```
2. Replace the placeholder API key:
   - In `gptbot.py`, replace:
     ```python
     openai.api_key = "sk-###your-api-key-here###"
     ```
     with your actual OpenAI API key.
3. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python gptbot.py
   ```
4. A link will be generated; open it in your browser and start chatting!

## Notes

- **basic_bot.py** is fully offline and beginner-friendly.
- **gptbot.py** needs internet access and a valid OpenAI API key.
- Both projects are great starting points for learning chatbot development!
